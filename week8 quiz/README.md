## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

Inspired by a Bilibili video on generative art, I adopted fluid and Processing techniques to emulate classical Chinese ink painting backgrounds. The image, reminiscent of ink dispersed by water, dynamically interacts with mouse movements, diffusing colors like smoke. Such effectiveness reminds me of the classical Chinese brush painting method of drawing. Fluid simulation enhances my projects, evoking mystery and mirroring the misty water effects seen in Monet's 'Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule'.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I will be using Pixelflow as my library to use. Because this library contains a series of fluids, particles, and lighting algorithms. I want to present an excellent visual effect of smoke and water flow on an image. In that case, this library can generate a realistic visual effect image based on fluid simulation methods. The coding software should be P5 because the case author uses Processing3, but P5 and processing can be converted. I favor using P5.
